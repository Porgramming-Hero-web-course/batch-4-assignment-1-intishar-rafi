**Unlock the Power of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript**

Powerful features of TypeScript, such as union and intersection types, can change the way we write code.

# Union Types:

Union types let a value be one of several different types. This is useful when dealing with various input or output scenarios:

```typescript
function processInput(input: string | number) {}
```

Here , By using the | operator, I've created a union type that allows the input parameter to be of type string or number. This flexibility ensures that the function can handle a wider range of inputs, making the code more adaptable and less prone to errors.

# Intersection Types:

Intersection types join multiple types together into one, and inherit the properties and methods of all the original types. This is useful when representing complex entities:

```typescript
type User = { name: string; email: string };
type Admin = { role: string; permissions: string[] };
type UserAdmin = User & Admin;
```

The `UserAdmin` type is an intersection of `User` and `Admin`, allowing to create objects with the characteristics of both.

In summary, union and intersection types allow us to write more adaptable code and enhance type safety. Mastering these TypeScript features will help developers create more flexible, expressive, and robust applications.
